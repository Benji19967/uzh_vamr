# Sandbox

The fist goal is to write nicely formatted code to achieve some of things we did during the exercises.
The second goal is to measure the time it takes run algorithms and compare their efficiencies.


## Things to do

- [x]: Read images
- [ ]: Calibrate my own (phone) camera
- [ ]: Extract features from one image
  - [ ]: Find keypoints
  - [ ]: Compute descriptors
- [ ]: Extract features from two images and match them
  - [ ] Brute-force matching
  - [ ] Smarter ways to match
- [ ]: Compute 3D point cloud from the features found in two images
- [ ]: Track objects in two frames that closely follow each other (KLT)
